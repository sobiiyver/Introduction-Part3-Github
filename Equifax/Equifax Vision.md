# Equifax Credit Score Inc.

## **Equifax Vision**

#### Credit score helps the financial institution to measure the credit risk of an individual before lending any loans. It helps the FI to analyse the paying habits of customers such as monthly bill payments, mortgage payments without any overdues. AI supports to cut down the cost via logistic regression

# Business Activities

## **Major Problems why the Credit Score are declining and remedies**

- Making late payment will remain on your Eqiifax credit report for certain years. It is allways recommended to pay your credit card bills ontime before your due dates, everytime.
- High Utilization credit ratio is another factor to reduce the credit score. Financial instituion generally prefer to see a lower debt to credit ratio between 30% to 45%.
- Too many inquires while shopping for an auto loan, home loan and inquiring for electronic device. Multiple inquires tipically counted as a single inquiry for a given period of time. Although it may vary depending on the credit risk and model.

## **Difference Between Equifax Credit Score and FICO Score**

**Fico Score**

- FICO score know as Fair Issac Corporation, commonly known and used in All three credit bureau called (Equifax, Transunion and Experian)
- Making Credit approval decision quickly using FICO scores
- Easy to verify the public records and lien againt the individuals

**Equifax Credit Score**

- Helps customers innovate faster, develop deeper insights, take smarter actions, and deliver better outcomes at scale.
- Understand credit scores, credit worthiness, and how credit scores are used in day-to-day life.
- Credit scores are based on your credit history and can play a significant role in the type of loan and loan terms, such as interest rate, a lender may offer you.

## **Logistic Regression**

- Risk prediction using data from the credit file is decades-old technology that is well understood by subject matter experts who rely on logistic regression methods tailored and tuned to extract significant performance from the data. If you see a 20 percent lift on credit data, or the promise of a 20 percent lift, be skeptical.
- An ML model will accurately capture these up and down trends, making the model more accurate than regression.

## **Neural Networks**

- Neural networks are “universal approximators” (improved accuracy) that are easy to implement in production (scorecard of scorecards) and fast to run in production.
- Just like traditional logistic regression models, only better. We input data forms attributes, and attributes into a NeuroDecision model.
- The NeuroDecision model outputs a three-digit numerical score, four reason codes, plus a fifth inquiry reason code.

## **Neuro Decision work better than logistic regression**

- We can put more input variables in the NDT model to improve performance.
- Use non-linear interactions between variables in the NDT model for more predictive power.

## **Discussion of regulatory constraints in deploying neural networks**

- NeuroDecision is a regulatory-compliant neural network technology for risk decision applications.
- Use it in predictive models that require reason codes. Equifax also has patents pending using other machine learning techniques.

# Conclusion
## **How Better Neuro Decissions actually worked in the field**

- NeuroDecision Technology (NDT) is the first regulatory-compliant machine learning credit scoring system reviewed by regulators and credit scoring experts.
- This technology develops a neural network model that improves performance and accuracy, which gives customers the ability to make more informed business decisions when assessing risk.
- This new technology to provide meaningful benefits to customers and consumers," said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data & Analytics Officer at Equifax.
